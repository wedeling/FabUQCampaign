# FabUQCampaign
This tutorial runs Advection Diffusion Equation (ADE) samples from a (local) [EasyVVUQ](https://github.com/UCL-CCS/EasyVVUQ) campaign using [FabSim3](https://github.com/djgroen/FabSim3) via the `campaign2ensemble` subroutine. Jobs can be executed locally or be sent to an HPC resource:

## Installation
To install all dependencies, first follow the instructions in https://github.com/wedeling/FabUQCampaign/blob/master/Tutorial_Setup.md

## Explanation of files

+ The `FabUQCampaign` directory contains all files listed below. This directory is located at `<fab_home>/plugins/FabUQCampaign`, where `<fab_home>` is your FabSim3 home directory.

+ `FabUQCampaign/examples/advection_diffusion/*`: an example script, applying EasyVVUQ to a 1D advection diffusion equation. See the Detailed Example section below.

+ `FabUQCampaign/templates/ade`: contains the command-line instruction to draw a single EasyVVUQ sample of the advection diffusion equation.

+ `FabUQCampaign/config_files/ade`: in this example this directory only contains the input configuration file for the ADE solver (described below). In more complex models, this directory contains any (configuration) file that you need to run your model. The contents of this directory will get copied to each ensemble run.

## Detailed Example

### Inputs
+ As noted, the template `FabUQCampaign/template/ade` contains the command line instruction to run a single sample, in this case: `python3 $ade_exec ade_in.json`. Here, `ade_in.json` is just the input file with the parameter values generated by EasyVVUQ. Furthermore, `$ade_exec` is the full path to the Python script which runs the advection diffusion equation at the parameters of `ade_in.json`. It must be specified in `fabsim/deploy/machines_user.yml`, which in this case looks like
 
`localhost:`

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`ade_exec: "<fab_home>/plugins/FabUQCampaign/examples/advection_diffusion/sc/ade_model.py"`

Here, `<fab_home>` is your FabSim3 home directory.

### Executing an ensemble job on localhost
The advection-diffusion equation is given by:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7Bdu%7D%7Bdx%7D%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BPe%7D%5Cfrac%7Bd%5E2u%7D%7Bdx%5E2%7D%3Df),

where the Peclet Number (Pe) and constant external forcing term (f) are the uncertain Stochastic Collocation (SC) parameters, and u is the velocity subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions u(0)=u(1)=0. The script executes the ensemble using FabSim, computes the first two moments of the output, generates some random sample of the SC surrogate and computes the Sobol indices of Pe and f.

The file `examples/advection_diffusion/sc/ade_model.py` contains the finite-element solver which receives the values of Pe and f.  Most steps are exactly the same as for an EasyVVUQ campaign that does not use FabSim to execute the runs. Here we'll outline the main step. Again, the full script can be found in the `FabUQCampaign/examples/advection_diffusion` directory.

We first define a couple of (constant) flags:

```python
# home directory
HOME = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
# Work directory, where the easyVVUQ directory will be placed
WORK_DIR = '/tmp'
# FabSim3 config name
CONFIG = 'ade'
# Simulation identifier
ID = '_test'
# EasyVVUQ campaign name
CAMPAIGN_NAME = CONFIG + ID
# name and relative location of the output file name
TARGET_FILENAME = './output.csv'
# location of the EasyVVUQ database
DB_LOCATION = "sqlite:///" + WORK_DIR + "/campaign%s.db" % ID
# Use QCG PilotJob or not
PILOT_JOB = False
# machine to run ensemble on
MACHINE = "localhost"
```

Most of these are self explanatory. Here, `CONFIG` is the name of the script that gets executed for each sample, in this case `ade`, which is located in `FabUQCampaign/templates/ade`, see "Explanation of files" above. `TARGET_FILENAME` is the name of the output file generated by the advection diffusion solver, and `DB_LOCATION` if the full path to the EasyVVUQ database, where all information about the Campaign is stored. Furthermore, the flag `PILOT_JOB` regulates the use of the QCG PilotJob mechanism. If `True`, FabSim will submit the ensemble to the (remote) host as a QCG PilotJob, which essentially means that all invididual jobs of the ensemble will get packaged into a single job allocation, thereby circumventing the limit on the maximum number of simultaneous jobs that is present on many supercomputers. For more info on the QCG PilotJob click [here](https://github.com/vecma-project/QCG-PilotJob). In this example we'll run the samples on the localhost (see `MACHINE`), and hence we set `PILOT_JOB=False`.

Next we define the parameter space of the advection diffusion equation, which consists of the uncertain parameters Pe and f, plus the name of the output file of `ade_model.py`:
 
```python
params = {
    "Pe": {
        "type": "real",
        "min": "1.0",
        "max": "2000.0",
        "default": "100.0"},
    "f": {
        "type": "real",
        "min": "0.0",
        "max": "10.0",
        "default": "1.0"},
    "out_file": {
        "type": "str",
        "default": "output.csv"}}
```
The `params` dict corresponds to the EasyVVUQ input template file `config_files/ade/ade.template`, which defines the input of a single model run. The content of this file is as follows:
```
{"outfile": "$out_file", "Pe": "$Pe", "f": "$f"}
```
More complex models will have more elaborate input files, but the concept remains the same. Replace the hardcoded value with a flag `$param`, and EasyVVUQ will replace the flag with a values drawn from the input distribution. To select which parameters of `params` are assigned a [Chaospy](https://chaospy.readthedocs.io/en/master/) input distribution, add these parameters to the `vary` dict, e.g.:

```python
vary = {
    "Pe": cp.Uniform(100.0, 200.0),
    "f": cp.Normal(1.0, 0.1)
}
```
Here we assigned a distribtuion to both inputs. If we had assigned a distribution to only `Pe` for example, the `$f` flag in the input file will be replaced by the `default` value defined in the `params` dict.

We now create an `actions` object that will create the run directories for each individual sample, and which will populate the input files with values using the `GenericEncoder`. An EasyVVUQ Campaign is then created, which is the overarching object that will link the database, sampler and analysis objects, see the EasyVVUQ tutorials for [more information](https://github.com/UCL-CCS/EasyVVUQ).

```python

encoder = uq.encoders.GenericEncoder(
    #the input file template is located in the FaubUQCampaign config_files folder
    template_fname= HOME + '/../../config_files/ade/ade.template',
    delimiter='$',
    target_filename='ade_in.json')

actions = uq.actions.Actions(
    uq.actions.CreateRunDirectory(root=WORK_DIR, flatten=True),
    uq.actions.Encode(encoder),
)

campaign = uq.Campaign(
    name=CAMPAIGN_NAME,
    db_location=DB_LOCATION,
    work_dir=WORK_DIR
)

campaign.add_app(
    name=CAMPAIGN_NAME,
    params=params,
    actions=actions
)
```
 
 Now we have to select a sampler, in this case we use the Stochastic Collocation (SC) sampler:
 
 ```python
sampler = uq.sampling.SCSampler(vary=vary, polynomial_order=4)

# Associate the sampler with the campaign
campaign.set_sampler(sampler)
 ```

If left unspecified, the polynomial order of the SC expansion will be set to 4. If instead we wish te use a Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) sampler, simply replace `SCSampler` with `PCESampler`.

To actually execute the `actions`, run

```python 
campaign.execute().collate()
```

### FabSim3-Python interface

We will use FabSim3 to execute the ensemble. FabSim3 is a commandline tool, but also has a Python interface that is simply a shell over the commandline tools. To import it use

```python
############################################
# Import the FabSim3 commandline interface #
############################################
import fabsim3_cmd_api as fab
```

To run the ensemble use
 
 ```python
###############################################
# run the UQ ensemble using FabSim3 interface #
###############################################

fab.run_uq_ensemble(CONFIG, campaign.campaign_dir, script='ade',
                    machine=MACHINE, PJ=PILOT_JOB)

# wait for job to complete
fab.wait(machine=MACHINE)

# check if all output files are retrieved from the remote machine, returns a Boolean flag
all_good = fab.verify(CONFIG, campaign.campaign_dir,
                      TARGET_FILENAME,
                      machine=MACHINE)

if all_good:
    # copy the results from the FabSim results dir to the EasyVVUQ results dir
    fab.get_uq_samples(CONFIG, campaign.campaign_dir, sampler.n_samples, machine=MACHINE)
else:
    print("Not all samples executed correctly")
    import sys
    sys.exit()

```
Briely:

* `fab.run_uq_ensemble`: this command submits the ensemble to the (remote) host for execution. Under the hood it uses the FabSim3 `campaign2ensemble` subroutine to copy the run directories from `WORK_DIR` to the FabSim3 `SWEEP` directory, located in 

Here `script` refers to the `templates/ade` file. Futhermore, `fab` is a simple FabSim API located in the same directory as the example script. It allows us to run FabSim commands from within a Python environment. Besides submitting the ensemble, `fab` is also used to retrieve the results when the job execution has completed:

```python
#fetch the results from the (remote) machine
fab.fetch_results()

#copy the samples back to EasyVVUQ dir
fab.get_uq_samples('ade', my_campaign.campaign_dir, my_sampler._number_of_samples,
                   machine='localhost')
```

Afterwards, post-processing tasks in EasyVVUQ continues in the normal fashion via:
```python
    sc_analysis = uq.analysis.SCAnalysis(sampler=my_sampler, qoi_cols=output_columns)
    my_campaign.apply_analysis(sc_analysis)
    results = my_campaign.get_last_analysis()
```
7. (continued) The `results` dict contains the first 2 statistical moments and Sobol indices for every quantity of interest defined in `output_columns`. If the PCE sampler was used, `SCAnalysis` should be replaced with `PCEAnalysis`.

### Executing an ensemble job on a remote host

To run the example script on a remote host, the `machine` of the remote host must be passed to `fab.run_uq_ensemble`, e.g.:

```python
 fab.run_uq_ensemble(my_campaign.campaign_dir, script_name='ade', machine='eagle_vecma')
```

Ensure the host is defined in `machines.yml`, and the user login information and `$ade_exec` in `deploy/machines_user.yml`. For the `eagle_vecma` machine, this will look similar to the following:
```
eagle_vecma:
 username: "plg<your_username>"
 budget: "vecma2019"
 ade_exec: "/home/plgrid/plg<your_username>/ade_model.py"
```

To automatically setup the ssh keys, and prevent having to login manually for every random sample, run the following from the command line:

```
fab eagle_vecma setup_ssh_keys
```

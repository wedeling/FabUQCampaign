# FabUQCampaign
This tutorial runs Advection Diffusion Equation (ADE) samples from a (local) ![EasyVVUQ](https://github.com/UCL-CCS/EasyVVUQ) campaign using ![FabSim3](https://github.com/djgroen/FabSim3) via the `campaign2ensemble` subroutine. Jobs can be executed locally or be sent to an HPC resource:

## Installation
To install all dependencies, first follow the instructions in https://github.com/wedeling/FabUQCampaign/blob/master/Tutorial_Setup.md

## Explanation of files

+ The `FabUQCampaign` directory contains all files listed below. This directory is located at `<fab_home>/plugins/FabUQCampaign`, where `<fab_home>` is your FabSim3 home directory.

+ `FabUQCampaign/examples/advection_diffusion/*`: an example script, applying EasyVVUQ to a 1D advection diffusion equation. See the Detailed Example section below.

+ `FabUQCampaign/templates/ade`: contains the command-line instruction to draw a single EasyVVUQ sample of the advection diffusion equation.

## Detailed Example

### Inputs
+ As noted, the template `FabUQCampaign/template/ade` contains the command line instruction to run a single sample, in this case: `python3 $ade_exec ade_in.json`. Here, `ade_in.json` is just the input file with the parameter values generated by EasyVVUQ. Furthermore, `$ade_exec` is the full path to the Python script which runs the advection diffusion equation at the parameters of `ade_in.json`. It must be specified in `fabsim/deploy/machines_user.yml`, which in this case looks like
 
`localhost:`

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`ade_exec: "<fab_home>/plugins/FabUQCampaign/examples/advection_diffusion/sc/ade_model.py"`

Here, `<fab_home>` is your FabSim3 home directory.

### Executing an ensemble job on localhost
The advection-diffusion equation is given by:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7Bdu%7D%7Bdx%7D%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BPe%7D%5Cfrac%7Bd%5E2u%7D%7Bdx%5E2%7D%3Df),

where the Peclet Number (Pe) and constant external forcing term (f) are the uncertain Stochastic Collocation (SC) parameters, and u is the velocity subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions u(0)=u(1)=0. The script executes the ensemble using FabSim, computes the first two moments of the output, generates some random sample of the SC surrogate and computes the Sobol indices of Pe and f.

The file `examples/advection_diffusion/sc/ade_model.py` contains the finite-element solver which receives the values of Pe and f.  Most steps are exactly the same as for an EasyVVUQ campaign that does not use FabSim to execute the runs. Here we'll outline the main step. Again, the full script can be found in the `FabUQCampaign/examples/advection_diffusion` directory.

We first define a couple of (constant) flags:

```python
# home directory
HOME = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
# Work directory, where the easyVVUQ directory will be placed
WORK_DIR = '/tmp'
# FabSim3 config name
CONFIG = 'ade'
# Simulation identifier
ID = '_test'
# EasyVVUQ campaign name
CAMPAIGN_NAME = CONFIG + ID
# name and relative location of the output file name
TARGET_FILENAME = './output.csv'
# location of the EasyVVUQ database
DB_LOCATION = "sqlite:///" + WORK_DIR + "/campaign%s.db" % ID
# Use QCG PilotJob or not
PILOT_JOB = False
# machine to run ensemble on
MACHINE = "localhost"
```

Most of these are self explanatory. Here, `CONFIG` is the name of the script that gets executed for each sample, in this case `ade`, which is located in `FabUQCampaign/templates/ade`, see "Explanation of files" above. `TARGET_FILENAME` is the name of the output file generated by the advection diffusion solver, and `DB_LOCATION` if the full path to the EasyVVUQ database, where all information about the Campaign is stored. Furthermore, the flag `PILOT_JOB` regulates the use of the QCG PilotJob mechanism. If `True`, FabSim will submit the ensemble to the (remote) host as a QCG PilotJob, which essentially means that all invididual jobs of the ensemble will get packaged into a single job allocation, thereby circumventing the limit on the maximum number of simultaneous jobs that is present on many supercomputers. For more info on the QCG PilotJob click [here](https://github.com/vecma-project/QCG-PilotJob). In this example we'll run the samples sequentailly on the localhost (see `MACHINE`), and hence we set `PILOT_JOB=False`.

Define the parameter space of the advection diffusion equation, which consists of the uncertain parameters Pe and f, plus the name of the output file of `ade_model.py`:
 
```python
    params = {
        "Pe": {
            "type": "real",
            "min": "1.0",
            "max": "2000.0",
            "default": "100.0"},
        "f": {
            "type": "real",
            "min": "0.0",
            "max": "10.0",
            "default": "1.0"},
        "out_file": {
            "type": "str",
            "default": "output.csv"}}
```
2. (continued): the `params` dict corresponds to the EasyVVUQ input template file `examples/advection_diffusion/sc/ade.template`, which defines the input of a single model run. The content of this file is as follows:
```
{"outfile": "$out_file", "Pe": "$Pe", "f": "$f"}
```
Select which paramaters of `params` are assigned a Chaospy input distribution, and add these paramaters to the `vary` dict, e.g.:

```python
    vary = {
        "Pe": cp.Uniform(100.0, 200.0),
        "f": cp.Normal(1.0, 0.1)
    }
```

Create an encoder and decoder element. The encoder links the input template file `examples/advection_diffusion/sc/ade.template` to the EasyVVUQ encoder, and defines the name of the input file (`ade_in.json`). The ade model `examples/advection_diffusion/sc/ade_model.py` writes the velocity output (`u`) to a simple `.csv` file, hence we select the `SimpleCSV` decoder:
```python
    encoder = uq.encoders.GenericEncoder(
        template_fname=HOME + '/model/model2.template',
        delimiter='$',
        target_filename='model_in.json')
    
    # actions for creating the run directories and encoding the input files
    actions = uq.actions.Actions(
        uq.actions.CreateRunDirectory(root=WORK_DIR, flatten=True),
        uq.actions.Encode(encoder),
    )

    # create an EasyVVUQ campaign
    campaign = uq.Campaign(
        name=CAMPAIGN_NAME,
        db_location=DB_LOCATION,
        work_dir=WORK_DIR
    )

    campaign.add_app(
        name=CAMPAIGN_NAME,
        params=params,
        actions=actions
    )
```
 
 Now we have to select a sampler, in this case we use the SC sampler:
 ```python
     my_sampler = uq.sampling.SCSampler(vary=vary, polynomial_order=3)
     my_campaign.set_sampler(my_sampler)
 ```
 
If left unspecified, the polynomial order of the SC expansion will be set to 4. If instead we wish te use a Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) sampler, simply replace `SCSampler` with `PCESampler`.
 
 The following commands ensure that we draw all samples, and create the ensemble run directories which will be used in FabSim's `campaign2ensemble` subroutine:
 ```python 
     my_campaign.draw_samples()
     my_campaign.populate_runs_dir()
 ```

The only part of the code that changes compared to a EasyVVUQ campaign without FabSim is the job execution, and the retrieval of the results. We use FabSim to run the ensemble via:
 
 ```python
 fab.run_uq_ensemble('ade', my_campaign.campaign_dir, script='ade')
 ```
Here `script` refers to the `templates/ade` file. Futhermore, `fab` is a simple FabSim API located in the same directory as the example script. It allows us to run FabSim commands from within a Python environment. Besides submitting the ensemble, `fab` is also used to retrieve the results when the job execution has completed:

```python
#fetch the results from the (remote) machine
fab.fetch_results()

#copy the samples back to EasyVVUQ dir
fab.get_uq_samples('ade', my_campaign.campaign_dir, my_sampler._number_of_samples,
                   machine='localhost')
```

Afterwards, post-processing tasks in EasyVVUQ continues in the normal fashion via:
```python
    sc_analysis = uq.analysis.SCAnalysis(sampler=my_sampler, qoi_cols=output_columns)
    my_campaign.apply_analysis(sc_analysis)
    results = my_campaign.get_last_analysis()
```
7. (continued) The `results` dict contains the first 2 statistical moments and Sobol indices for every quantity of interest defined in `output_columns`. If the PCE sampler was used, `SCAnalysis` should be replaced with `PCEAnalysis`.

### Executing an ensemble job on a remote host

To run the example script on a remote host, the `machine` of the remote host must be passed to `fab.run_uq_ensemble`, e.g.:

```python
 fab.run_uq_ensemble(my_campaign.campaign_dir, script_name='ade', machine='eagle_vecma')
```

Ensure the host is defined in `machines.yml`, and the user login information and `$ade_exec` in `deploy/machines_user.yml`. For the `eagle_vecma` machine, this will look similar to the following:
```
eagle_vecma:
 username: "plg<your_username>"
 budget: "vecma2019"
 ade_exec: "/home/plgrid/plg<your_username>/ade_model.py"
```

To automatically setup the ssh keys, and prevent having to login manually for every random sample, run the following from the command line:

```
fab eagle_vecma setup_ssh_keys
```
